Title: Building a Food Recommendation Website with React - Episode 1: Introduction and Project Setup

[Video opens with an introduction screen, and background music fades out. The presenter appears on screen.]

Presenter: "Welcome to our tutorial series on building a Food recommendation website with React! In this first episode, we'll introduce the project and set up our React app. Let's get started!"

[Screen transitions to a code editor with the presenter typing commands.]

Presenter: "First, let's create a new React app using create-react-app. Open your terminal and type:"

Copy code
```npx create-react-app Food-recommendations```

Presenter (voiceover): "This will create a new React app with the name 'Food-recommendations' and install all the necessary dependencies for us."

[Screen transitions to the terminal showing the command being executed and the progress of the installation.]

Presenter: "Once the installation is complete, navigate to the project folder by typing:"

```cd Food-recommendations```
Presenter (voiceover): "This will take us to the project folder where we can start building our Food recommendation website."

[Screen transitions to the code editor with the presenter explaining the project structure.]

Presenter: "Now, let's take a look at the project structure. Inside the 'src' folder, we have our main app component 'App.js' and the CSS file 'App.css'. We'll be working with these files to build our Food recommendation website."

[Screen transitions to the browser with the presenter running the React app locally.]

Presenter: "To run the app locally and see the changes in the browser, type:"

```npm start```
Presenter (voiceover): "This will start the development server and open our Food recommendation website in the browser."

[Screen shows the Food recommendation website running in the browser, and the presenter interacts with it.]

Presenter: "Great! Our React app is up and running. In the next episode, we'll fetch Food data from an API and render Food listings with React components. Stay tuned!"

[Video ends with a closing screen and the presenter waving goodbye.]
